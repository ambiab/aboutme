    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>As part of my plan to build up experience in front end development, I decided to build this website to document my coding journey!
        I have a background in History, but I've slowly been growing an interest in development. It all started in January 2018 when I applied for the CodeFirst:Girls Beginners course! 
        I was offered a place on the course to learn HTML, CSS, JS and more with the developers at Google. I've also recently finished the CodeFirst:Girls Advanced Python course at QuantumBlack!
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently working in a Systems role, I am slowly working on building my own projects in addition to those I worked on during my CodeFirst:Girls courses so I can hopefully pursure a career in front end development!
