        <p>As part of my plan to build up experience in front end development, I decided to build this website to document my coding journey!
        I have a background in History, but I've slowly been developing an interest in web development.<br><br>

        <h3>CodeFirstGirls: Beginners</h3>
        <p>I began my first experience of coding at the start of 2018. I was accepted on the CodeFirstGirls beginners course which took place at Google.<br><br>
        We learnt HTML, CSS, JS and more! The first few weeks were quite overwhelming given that I had no experience of coding before and I felt like I had to change how my brain worked.
        It took time, patience and I definitely had to reach out for help (the best way to learn coding). 
        By the end of the course, I had built a website in a team of 3 using all the skills we had learnt throughout the course.
