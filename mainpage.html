    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <div class="introduction">
        <p>As part of my plan to build up experience in front end development, I decided to build this website to document my coding journey!
        I have a background in History, but I've slowly been developing an interest in web development.<br><br>

        <h3>CodeFirstGirls: Beginners</h3>
        <p>I began my first experience of coding at the start of 2018. I was accepted on the CodeFirstGirls beginners course which took place at Google.<br><br>
        We learnt HTML, CSS, JS and more! The first few weeks were quite overwhelming given that I had no experience of coding before and I felt like I had to change how my brain worked.
        It took time, patience and I definitely had to reach out for help (the best way to learn coding). 
        By the end of the course, I had built a website in a team of 3 using all the skills we had learnt throughout the course.

        <h3>Moving over to Systems</h3>
        <p>I had spent the last year working as an assistant in the LSE Summer School. While fun, I wanted to try going down a tech career path but I was still very unsure
            of how to do this with the little experience I had. <br><br>
            I came across a job advertisement for an entry level position in the university System's department. Alreading possessing experience of the systems used and some coding knowledge, I applied. 
            I was offered the role on the day and was ready to dip my toes into the world of tech!<br><br> When I started, I felt very overwhelmed. There was a lot of stuff to learn and again, I felt like
            I had to change how my brain worked to udnerstand a lot of the stuff we worked on. It took at least 2 months for me to find my feet and I'm still learning! This position is good as it allows
            me to dabble in coding, work on my own projects alongside my work while learning new languages (especially SQL) and building on my Salesforce knowledge.
