        <h3>Moving over to Systems</h3>
        <p>I had spent the last year working as an assistant in the LSE Summer School. While fun, I wanted to try going down a tech career path but I was still very unsure
            of how to do this with the little experience I had. <br><br>
            I ended up starting a role in the Systems department. When I started, I felt very overwhelmed. There was a lot of stuff to learn and it took at least 3 months for me to find my feet and I'm still learning! This position is good as it allows
            me to dabble in coding, work on my own projects alongside my work while learning new languages (especially SQL) and building on my Salesforce knowledge.

        <h3>CodeFirstGirls: Advanced (Python)</h3>
        <p>A year on from my first CFG course and I wanted to tackle the Advanced! Accepted onto the Python course run at QuantumBlack, I continued my coding journey! The Python course
            was a big jump from last year. There was a lot to learn and only 8 weeks to learn it all. We covered Python, Flask, Jinga, Command and more!<br><br>
            I found the Python course a lot more difficult than the Beginners. It required a lot 
            of outside time and concentration in class. By the end of the course, my team mate and I had built a website based on hiking and pulling in data from our database using SQL and Python. 
            You can see it in my Projects.
